List the contents of a directory. Output is sorted alphabetically on filename
by default. The following flags are supported:

-a: (BONUS)
    Shows all hidden files.
-C: (BONUS)
    Forces multi-column output, even if not outputting to a terminal.
-l:
    Uses long-list format.
-R:
    Recurses into directories.
-t:
    Sorts on last modification time.
-S:
    Sorts on file size.
-f:
    Disables sorting.

The benefit of the -a flag is obvious: it allows us to see hidden files. As a
consequence, we can also see the special '.' and '..' directories when using
this flag.

The -C flag is useful when you want multi-column output when not in a terminal.
For example, it was very useful for debugging in an IDE.
